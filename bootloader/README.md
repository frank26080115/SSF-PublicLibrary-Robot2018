## Optiboot Bootloader for Arduino and Atmel AVR ##

Modified for use with the SSF Public Library Robot project. Added a button for easier bootloader activation (due to USB driver issues on library computers).

Optiboot is an easy to install upgrade to the Arduino bootloader within Arduino boards. It provides the following features:

  * Allows larger sketches. Optiboot is a quarter of the size of the default bootloader, freeing 1.5k of extra space.
  * Makes your sketches upload faster. Optiboot operates at higher baud rates and has streamlined programming.
  * Adaboot performance improvements. Optiboot runs your sketches sooner, with no watchdog issues.
  * Compatible with 168 and 328 Arduinos including Lilypad, Pro, Nano
  * Believed to work with ATmega1280 ("Mega"), ATmega644 ("Sanguino"), and ATmega1284 ("Mighty")
  * Supports several additional AVR chips (ATmega88, ATmega32)

Optiboot is now installed by default on the Arduino Uno. It can be installed on all older mega8, 168 or 328 based Arduinos.

## To install into the Arduino software ##
  1. Download the latest using Git or the Zip download feature of GutHub.  If you download as a zip, also extract it.
  1. You will need to be using a recent version of the [Arduino environment](http://arduino.cc), version 18 or later.
  1. Create a 'hardware' directory inside your sketches folder.
  1. Copy the optiboot directory into the hardware directory.
  1. Restart the Arduino software. New boards will appear in the Tools>Board menu.

## To burn Optiboot onto an Arduino board ##
  1. Select the appropriate Optiboot board type (or non-Optiboot if you want to change back)
  1. Connect your Arduino to an ISP programmer [[Installing]]
  1. Use the 'Burn Bootloader' item in Arduino.
  1. You can then upload sketches as normal, using the Optiboot board type.

Kyle (stk500boot.c), [Arduino group (bootloader)](http://arduino.cc), [Spiff (1K bootloader)](http://spiffie.org/know/arduino_1k_bootloader/bootloader.shtml), [AVR-Libc group](http://nongnu.org/avr-libc) and [Ladyada (Adaboot)](http://www.ladyada.net/library/arduino/bootloader.html).

> Maintenance of optiboot was taken over by Bill Westfield (aka WestfW) in 2011.
