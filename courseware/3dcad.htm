<h1>Welcome to the 3D CAD Modelling Class</h1>

<fieldset>
<legend>Before Coming to Class</legend>
<div>
<p>This class will use <a href="https://www.onshape.com/" target="_blank">Onshape</a>. It is a CAD tool that runs in a web browser, and an account is required to use it. It is free to use and similar to many more CAD tools that exist in the professional world.</p>
<p>Please sign up for an account with Onshape before class starts. We do not want to waste time during the class.</p>
<p><a href="https://cad.onshape.com/signup2" target="_blank">Click Here</a> to sign up. You will need an email address, that's all. Please remember your email and password when you come to class.</p>
<p>Onshape offers a <a href="https://learn.onshape.com/collections/onshape-fundamentals-cad" target="_blank">few video tutorials</a> that you can watch, but they are targeted towards a professional audience. You can try to watch these videos, but don't worry if you get a bit confused sometimes. Our own class will be much easier to digest.</p>

<legend>Have you used any 3D modelling tools before?</legend>
<div>
<p>If you have used TinkerCAD or SketchUp, or something similar, please understand that those kind of tools are not really professional engineering tools. They are more meant for kids and art. When you want to make an object that "does something", use a tool meant for mechanical engineering. When you want to make something that "looks good", use a tool meant for artists. If you use the wrong tool for the wrong purposes, you will have a harder time and learn bad habits.</p>
<p>These tools are awesome for engineering: Onshape, SolidWorks, CATIA, Autodesk Inventor, Autodesk Fusion 360, Siemens NX, Solid Edge</p>
<p>These tools are meant for other people: TinkerCAD, SketchUp, Blender, SCAD, OpenSCAD, 3DS Max, Rhino 3D</p>
<p>Onshape and Fusion 360 are both free to use. SolidWorks and Autodesk Inventor are expensive tools but are often given to secondary and post-secondary education organizations. CATIA and Siemens NX are tools meant for designing something as complex as an entire airplane, usually dedicated mechanical engineering curriculums in college will cover these tools.</p>

<h2>Our Goal Today</h2>

<p>We'll be 3D modelling the body of our robot. It's a simple plate with a few boss features to hold our motors and our batteries. At the end, we will 3D print the model we create.</p>

<p><img src="img/cad_finished.png" width="100%"/></p>
<p><img src="img/cad_realized.jpg" width="100%"/></p>

<p>This class will contain a lot of videos. You should be viewing this lesson in a web browser. View them full screen if you can't see something clearly.</p>

<h2>Get Started</h2>

<p>Please open up <a href="https://cad.onshape.com/" target="_blank">Onshape (click here)</a>, sign in with your email and password, and create a new document. You can give it any name you like.</p>

<h2>Your First Sketch</h2>

<p>Everything starts with a sketch. A sketch can be made on any flat surface or plane. There are three main planes that are always available: top, right, front. We will make the first rectangular block as a sketch on the top plane.</p>

<video controls="controls" loop="loop" preload="none">
  <source src="vid/cad_startingfirstsketch.mp4" type="video/mp4">

</video>

<p>Drawing a rectangle simply involves clicking the rectangle tool on the toolbar, and then starting and ending the rectangle.</p>

<video controls="controls" loop="loop" preload="none">
  <source src="vid/cad_drawingarectangle.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

<p>Things in your sketch can be given dimensions. We want to make this rectangle exactly 60mm wide and 65mm long. The dimension tool is on the toolbar, then pick the object(s) you want to dimension, pick a place to show the dimension, and finally type in the numbers.</p>

<p>Here are some other ways of dimensioning things.</p>

<h2>Turning a Sketch 3 Dimensional</h2>

<p>The simplest way to turn a 2D sketch into a 3D solid is to "extrude" it. You can extrude an enclosed sketch (like a rectangle) to a certain length.</p>

<h2>Making Changes and Edits</h2>

<p>A good CAD tool must allow you to make changes to your model, designs change often and people make mistakes. It's easy to edit a sketch even after you've exited or extruded it, and it is easy to change the parameters of your extrusion as well. Simply right-click on the sketch or extrude operation in the "feature list" (left side of the screen) and then click edit.</p>

<fieldset class="hidable">
<legend>What do you mean by "Features"?</legend>
<div>
<p>In 3D CAD software, a "feature" is a term used to describe almost any part of a model. A sketch is a feature, an extrusion is a feature, just like how your nose is a feature of your face.</p>

<p>On the left side of the screen, you will see a list of features. The order of the features do matter, they are listed in the order in which they are applied/added. Think of the list as a list of instructions for the computer to create your model. You are able to change this order if you need to.</p>
</div>
</fieldset>

<h2>Making Bosses on Your Rectangle</h2>

<p>There are 6 little rectangular bosses on the flat rectangular plate. 4 of these are meant to attach your servo motors, and 2 are meant to attach your battery holder. First, start the sketch on top of the flat rectangular plate. Since the design is symmetrical, we can use the "mirror" tool later, this means you should draw some "mirror lines" using the construction line tool.</p>

<video controls="controls" loop="loop" preload="none">
  <source src="vid/cad_startingsecondsketch.mp4" type="video/mp4">

</video>

<p>Draw the rectangles inside this sketch. There are only two to start with, and you'll end up with all 6 after using the mirror function twice.</p>

<p>Now here is the video that teaches you how to use the mirror tool.</p>

<fieldset>
<legend>Constraints in CAD</legend>
<div>
<p>A good CAD tool will allow you to add constraints to the objects in your sketches. The constraints in your sketch is a list of rules that the sketch must follow. When you add a dimension to a line, that's actually a constraint, it's a rule that says "this line must be this long".</p>

<p>When the cursor snaps to a midpoint, it means "automatically make a midpoint constraint". A midpoint constraint is a rule that says "this object must always be in the middle of this line, even if the line moves, extends, or shrinks". The "coincident" constraint is also very frequently automatically generated, it simply means "this object must always touch that object".</p>

<p>When you use the mirror tool, that's a mirror constraint being created. When you manipulate one object in the constraint, the mirrored object will also be affected in the same way, but symetrically about the mirror line.</p>

<p>When you use constraints, you will make less mistakes. For example, if you have a symetrical design, and the things on the left needs to change, without a mirror constraint, you might forget to make the same changes to the right side.</p>

<p>You will see more types of constraints later.</p>

<p>When an object is black, it means you've given the computer enough constraints (rules) to know where the object should be and how big it should be. When an object is blue, it means the computer is not very sure yet, you should add more constraints. You can probably move blue objects by dragging it with your mouse. When something is red, it means you've given rules that the computer can't follow, for example, telling it a line must be 5mm long but also go between two points that are 10mm apart.</p>
</div>
</fieldset>

<p>Next we will give the bosses some dimensions. This will also show you how when you move objects on one side of a mirror line, the mirrored objects on the other side will move as well.</p>

</video>

<fieldset class="hidable">
<legend>How did you know what these dimensions should be?</legend>
<div>
<p>The bosses should be far apart with a gap to fit the servo motor. When I purchased the servo motor, it came with a drawing telling me exactly how wide it is. If it didn't have a drawing, then I could simply use a ruler or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calipers#Vernier_caliper" target="_blank">caliper</a> to measure the servo motor first.</p>

<p>The same applies to the battery holder. Look for a drawing, and if you can't find one, then measure it yourself.</p>

<p>Since we are using a good CAD tool and a 3D printer, you can always correct your mistakes later. A lot of times, you might even have to guess and print out different copies with different dimensions and see which one works the best. Do what you have to do to get the job done.</p>
</div>
</fieldset>

<p>This sketch is done, so now we can use the extrude tool again to turn it 3 dimensional. We make it as high as the servo motors are thick.</p>

<h2>House Keeping</h2>

<p>When a 3D model becomes more and more complex, it's a good idea to name your features. This way, you and other people can know where to go when there needs to be a change made.</p>

<video controls="controls" loop="loop" preload="none">

<h2>Holes</h2>

<p>Some really complex models can have hundreds of features. Remember that in a professional situation, you will be working with other people who need to understand your model as well.</p>

<p>Each servo has two holes on it, and we will be using screws to attach them to the robot. We need to cut holes into the bosses for these screws. This is done by drawing circles on the side of the bosses, and then using the extrude tool in remove mode.</p>

<p>While in remove mode, we can choose "through all", which tells the tool to cut through the entire model, instead of to a certain depth. (this means you can make the model thicker later and still have the hole go all the way through)</p>

<h2>Attaching the Battery Holder</h2>

<p>The battery holder has two holes on it, and we will be using screws to attach it to the robot. We will cut holes into the model like we did before.</p>

<p>First start with the sketch of a circle, using center-lines to help you position it exactly. Mirroring is used to create the second circle.</p>

<p>(this video below also shows how to reuse sketches for constraints, in which case, constraints are not added automatically, so you must manually add them)</p>

<video controls="controls" loop="loop" preload="none">
  <source src="vid/cad_battholdercirclessketch.mp4" type="video/mp4">

</video>

<p>Finally, use the extrude tool in remove mode to do the cutting. Again, using "through all" instead of a depth.</p>

<video controls="controls" loop="loop" preload="none">
  <source src="vid/cad_battholdercirclescut.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

<p>One of our holes should become a slot shape. This involves making a narrow rectangle and using extrude-remove.</p>

<fieldset class="hidable">
<legend>Why are we using a slot shape?</legend>
<div>
<p>When I was shopping for battery holders, they all look kind of similar, they mostly had two holes you could put screws in. But when I measured the distance between the two holes... </p>
<p><img src="img/twodifferentbattholders2.jpg" width="100%"/></p>
<p>... some manufactures put the holes just slightly closer together, or slightly further apart. This means if we had two holes on our robot, the battery holder might not fit on it because the holes will not line up. By using a slot instead, it could fit more battery holders with different hole spacing.</p>
</div>
</fieldset>

<video controls="controls" loop="loop" preload="none">
  <source src="vid/cad_battholderslot.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

<p>We used "cut up to surface" mode here instead of specifying a depth. This means the bosses can be made taller or shorter, but the cutting depth will always go right up to the flat plate.</p>

<h2>Holding the Circuit Board</h2>

<p>The front of the robot body has a slight extension that will attach to the circuit board.</p>

<p><img src="img/cad_holdingpcb.jpg" width="100%"/></p>

<p>This is done in CAD with a simple rectangular sketch followed by an extrude-add operation.</p>

<video controls="controls" loop="loop" preload="none">
  <source src="vid/cad_frontextension.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

<p>The circuit board attaches to the 3D printed body with some pins, we need to make some slots for these pins in our 3D model. We will start with a thin rectangle in the front of the robot, on the bottom side, where we just made the extension. We center it using constraints made with older sketches.</p>

<video controls="controls" loop="loop" preload="none">
  <source src="vid/cad_pinslotsstart.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

<p>We need a lot of slots, so this will teach you how to use the pattern tool, so you can make many rectangles from a single rectangle. We make the pattern on one side, and then mirror all of the rectangles created by the pattern.</p>

<p>Finally, the slots are cut into the plate, using the extrude tool in remove mode.</p>

<h2>Congratulations, You Are Finished!</h2>

<p>If you did all that, you are finished making your 3D model.</p>

<p><img src="img/cad_finished.png" width="100%"/></p>

<h2>3D Printing</h2>

<p>Export the part from Onshape. Give it a name, use STL binary format with millimeter units. After the file is downloaded, use your slicer tool (in our case, <a href="https://ultimaker.com/en/products/ultimaker-cura-software" target="_blank">Ultimaker Cura</a>) to prepare the GCODE file for printing. Remember to rotate the model so that the flat side is on the bottom. Use 0.2mm or 0.3mm for layer height if possible, with 30% - 50% infill, no support or adhesion should be necessary.</p>

<h2>Other 3D Printed Parts</h2>

<p>The robot has sensor shrouds that are 3D printed. These shrouds make sure that ambient room lighting and sunlight doesn't disturb the floor sensors. To minimize reflection, black plastic is used, you shouldn't make these out of any other colour.</p>

<p><img src="img/cad_sensorshroud.jpg" width="100%"/></p>

<p>The 3D model is here: <a href="https://cad.onshape.com/documents/dfbadef91def13912093eda3/w/abea147705b7d4333185574d/e/85bbda042aa3724f9a994a56" target="_blank">link to Onshape 3D model</a></p>

<p>Think of this as homework. Try to 3D model this part yourself using Onshape. Since I already made the model, you can actually view all of my sketches and features.</p>

<p>Also, just play around with your 3D model. Try out what all of the tools do. Make your own 3D models and come to the library to 3D print them. With more practice you'll be able to do more amazing things, and learning CAD is essential to being an engineer.</p>
