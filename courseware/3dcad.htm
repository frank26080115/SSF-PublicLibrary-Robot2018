<h1>Welcome to the 3D CAD Modelling Class</h1>

<fieldset>
<legend>Before Coming to Class</legend>
<p>This class will use <a href="https://www.onshape.com/" target="_blank">Onshape</a>. It is a CAD tool that runs in a web browser, and an account is required to use it. It is free to use and similar to many more CAD tools that exist in the professional world.</p>
<p>Please sign up for an account with Onshape before class starts. We do not want to waste time during the class.</p>
<p><a href="https://cad.onshape.com/signup2" target="_blank">Click Here</a> to sign up. You will need an email address, that's all. Please remember your email and password when you come to class.</p>
<p>Onshape offers a <a href="https://learn.onshape.com/collections/onshape-fundamentals-cad" target="_blank">few video tutorials</a> that you can watch, but they are targeted towards a professional audience. You can try to watch these videos, but don't worry if you get a bit confused sometimes. Our own class will be much easier to digest.</p>

<legend>Have you used any 3D modelling tools before? <a onclick="document.getElementById('extra-othercad').style.display='block';">(click here to see hidden extra content)</a></legend>
<div class="extra" id="extra-othercad">
<p>If you have used TinkerCAD or SketchUp, or something similar, please understand that those kind of tools are not really professional engineering tools. They are more meant for kids and art. When you want to make an object that "does something", use a tool meant for mechanical engineering. When you want to make something that "looks good", use a tool meant for artists. If you use the wrong tool for the wrong purposes, you will have a harder time and learn bad habits.</p>
<p>These tools are awesome for engineering: Onshape, SolidWorks, CATIA, Autodesk Inventor, Autodesk Fusion 360, Siemens NX, Solid Edge</p>
<p>These tools are meant for other people: TinkerCAD, SketchUp, Blender, SCAD, OpenSCAD, 3DS Max, Rhino 3D</p>
<p>Onshape and Fusion 360 are both free to use. SolidWorks and Autodesk Inventor are expensive tools but are often given to secondary and post-secondary education organizations. CATIA and Siemens NX are tools meant for designing something as complex as an entire airplane, usually dedicated mechanical engineering curriculums will cover these tools.</p>

<h2>Our Goal Today</h2>

<p>We'll be 3D modelling the body of our robot. It's a simple plate with a few boss features to hold our motors and our batteries. At the end, we will 3D print the model we create.</p>
<p>This class will contain a lot of videos. This means printing out this page will not work, you should only be viewing this lesson in a web browser.</p>

<h2>Get Started</h2>

<p>Please open up <a href="https://cad.onshape.com/" target="_blank">Onshape (click here)</a>, sign in with your email and password, and create a new document. You can give it any name you like.</p>

<h2>Your First Sketch</h2>
