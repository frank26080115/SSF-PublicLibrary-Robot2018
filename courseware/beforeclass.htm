<h1>Before Class</h1>

<fieldset><legend>Onshape Account</legend>
<div>
<p>The first class will use <a href="https://www.onshape.com/" target="_blank">Onshape</a>. It is a CAD tool that runs in a web browser, and an account is required to use it. It is free to use and similar to many more CAD tools that exist in the professional world.</p>
<p><b>Please sign up for an account with Onshape before class starts. We do not want to waste time during the class.</b></p>
<p><a href="https://cad.onshape.com/signup2" target="_blank">Click Here</a> to sign up. You will need an email address, that's all. If the registration process asks weird questions, fill in made-up answers and a fake phone number. <b>Please remember your email and password when you come to class.</b></p>
<p>Onshape offers a <a href="https://learn.onshape.com/collections/onshape-fundamentals-cad" target="_blank">few video tutorials</a> that you can watch, but they are targeted towards a professional audience. You can try to watch these videos, but don't worry if you get a bit confused sometimes. Our own class will be much easier to digest.</p>
</div>

<fieldset><legend>Set your Onshape account to use metric</legend>
<div>
<p>Our robot is designed with metric measurements (meaning using SI units, like meters and millimeters, not inches). It'll be harder to make a mistake if you switched your Onshape account to use millimeters instead of inches for measurements. Follow the instructions below to change the default measurement units to millimeters:</p>

<fieldset><legend>Your Own Computer</legend>
<p>It'll be great if you could bring your own laptops to class, along with a mouse. It'll make it much easier to save your files during the Arduino class. It's almost impossible to do CAD work without a mouse.</p>

<p>The library does have enough laptops and a bunch of mouse that we can use, but the library laptops are restrictive. The restrictions forces us do some extra steps during the class. Students who have their own laptops can skip a few steps.</p>

<p>If you do plan on using the library's laptops, then please bring a USB flash drive with you. Ideally 8GB or larger.</p>
