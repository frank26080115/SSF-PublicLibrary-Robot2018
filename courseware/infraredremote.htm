<h1>Infrared Remote Control</h1>

<p>We can make your robot remote controlled by any TV remote. If you have attended the classes, I have given you a little device that is the infrared remote receiver. This lesson will teach you how to connect it to your robot, and how to make your robot read commands from your TV remote.</p>

<h2>Using a Breadboard</h2>

<p>A <i>solderbreadboard is a type of circuit board that does not require soldering, instead, you simply plug in wires and components into it. You can also take the components out really easily. This all means that breadboards makes it easy to fix any mistakes.</p>

<p>(using a breadboard also means your circuit will break if you drop it, since the components can pop out easily)</p>
