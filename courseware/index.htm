<h2>Our Robot</h2>

<p>I designed this robot for you guys to learn the basics of robotics. You will learn skills in many areas of engineering and computer science while you build this robot.</p>

<p>To build the robot, the participants will be given a few classes, the parts and tools will be provided during these classes. The classes have pages that use videos, pictures, and interactive activities that you must read before coming to class. If you are unable to come to class, you can still build the robot following the instructions provided in these pages.</p>

<h2>Parts and Features of the Robot</h2>
<ul>
<li>Brain: Arduino Nano, reprogrammable, removable, and can communicate data to a computer</li>
<li>Two sensors for the floor, allowing the robot to follow lines and detect boundaries</li>
<li>Two sensors on the sides, allowing the robot to detect objects, chase or avoid objects</li>
<li>Button and potentiometer inputs, for user interaction</li>
<li>LEDs that can blink and change brightness, for indication purposes</li>
<li>Two motors and wheels so the robot can move</li>
<li>Runs on four AA batteries</li>
<li>Circuit board and breadboard allows for additional parts to be installed</li>
</ul>

<h2>Classes</h2>

<p>Click on the links below to read the class material. Open the same links when you attend the class at the library.</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="3dcad.htm">3D CAD Modelling</a>, design the 3D model of the robot's body, and then 3D print it</li>
<li><a href="circuitbasics.htm">Circuit Basics</a>, learn some electronics and how the robot's circuit works</li>
<li><a href="robotassembly.htm">Robot Assembly</a>, learn soldering, and put the robot together using hand tools</li>
<li><a href="arduinoclass.htm">Arduino Programming</a>, learn how to read, run, and write Arduino code, make the robot do things</li>
<li>Extra Class: <a href="connectingmoreparts.htm">adding parts to the robot</a> , make the robot remote controlled by adding a TV remote control receiver</li>
</ol>

<p>If you plan on attending the classes, please register with the library first, and please fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScAOJIPM2_1hqUY_7gPOVo14ICTEU5GpytTrmvJvYdAuYPx8w/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank">my survey (click here)</a>. We need to make sure we have enough parts.</p>

<h2>Special Thanks</h2>

<p>A big thanks to Microchip Technology. My professional contacts at their local office generously donated an insane amount of screwdrivers (with flashlights!) and swag.</p>
<div class="center_outer"><div class="center_inner"><a href="img/thanks_microchip.jpg"><img src="img/thanks_microchip.jpg" width="100%" /></a></div></div>
<p>Their kindness will not be forgotten. Personally I thank Microchip for jumpstarting my own path in this hobby and career. Microchip Technology is a huge supporter of STEM programs, I definitely have many of their dev kits simply because they handed them out to me in university. Even when I was a poor highschooler, I got started with their PIC microcontrollers because they were essentially free. I truly believe they are the reason why I am insanely good at writing low-level bare-metal embedded firmware. By the time Arduino Diecimila (the first Arduino with USB) was available, I immediately outgrew the Arduino IDE because of just how far using a PIC has pushed me.</p>
