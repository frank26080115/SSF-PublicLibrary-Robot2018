# SSF-PublicLibrary-Robot2018

This repo contains the hardware, software, and courseware of a small robotics STEM education program. This program is targeting ages 12+, involves 3 live classes held at South San Francisco Public Library, and a robot that's insanely cheap but also incredibly educational.

Perhaps the data here is useful for other educational organizations on a budget.

Please click "Clone or Download" and then "Download ZIP". When the ZIP file is downloaded, unzip it somewhere and open "courseware/index.htm" with a web browser. This will start the course. All the courseware is written as web pages, with pictures, videos, and interactive demos.

## Software Required

- Arduino 1.8.1 (this is what SSF Public Library has currently installed)
- Onshape account (free web browser based CAD software that mimics SolidWorks)

## Thanks to:

### Microchip Technology

A big thanks to Microchip Technology. My professional contacts at their San Jose office generously donated an insane amount of screwdrivers and swag. Their kindness will not be forgotten. Personally I thank Microchip for jumpstarting my own path in this hobby and career. Microchip Technology is a huge supporter of STEM programs, I definitely have many of their dev kits simply because they handed them out to me in university. Even when I was a poor highschooler, I got started with their PIC microcontrollers because they were essentially free. I truly believe they are the reason why I am insanely good at writing low-level bare-metal embedded firmware. By the time Arduino Diecimila (the first Arduino with USB) was available, I immediately hated using the Arduino IDE because of just how far using a PIC has pushed me.
