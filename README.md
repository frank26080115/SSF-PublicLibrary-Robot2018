# SSF-PublicLibrary-Robot2018

This repo contains the hardware, software, and courseware of a small robotics STEM education program. This program is targeting ages 12+, involves 3 live classes held at South San Francisco Public Library, and a robot that's insanely cheap but also incredibly educational.

Perhaps the data here is useful for other educational organizations on a budget.

Please click "Clone or Download" and then "Download ZIP". When the ZIP file is downloaded, unzip it somewhere and open "courseware/index.htm" with a web browser. This will start the course. All the courseware is written as web pages, with pictures, videos, and interactive demos.

The lessons are also hosted on my own website, http://eleccelerator.com/ssfpl_robotics_class_2018/

## Software Required

- Arduino 1.8.1 (this is what SSF Public Library has currently installed)
- Onshape account (free web browser based CAD software that mimics SolidWorks)

## Thanks to: Microchip Technology

A big thanks to Microchip Technology.  These guys manufactures the chip in the middle of your Arduinos. My professional contacts at their local office generously donated an insane amount of screwdrivers and backpacks. These classes would not have been possible without their help. Their kindness will not be forgotten.

Personally I thank Microchip for jumpstarting my own path in this hobby and career. Microchip Technology is a huge supporter of STEM programs, I definitely have many of their dev kits simply because they handed them out to me in university. Even when I was a poor highschooler, I got started with their PIC microcontrollers because they were essentially free. I truly believe they are the reason why I am insanely good at writing low-level bare-metal embedded firmware. By the time Arduino Diecimila (the first Arduino with USB) was available, I immediately outgrew the Arduino IDE because of just how far using a PIC has pushed me.

## Thanks to: Adafruit Industries

Adafruit Industries is a founding pillar of the maker movement from the very beginning, and a champion for women engineers and entrepreneurs. Limor "Ladyada" Fried and Phillip Torrone (former senior editor at Make: Magazine, Hackaday, Popular Science, Howtoons) donated all the soldering irons we need that makes these classes possible. These irons are the good stuff, coated tips, adjustable ceramic heaters, fire-proof wiring!

As a huge supporter of STEAM education, Adafruit Industries have written literally thousands of guides and tutorials, along side their amazing collection of products that makes it easy for everyday people to accomplish what used to be impossible. How do I know they are so good? I used to work for Adafruit myself, I wrote some of those tutorials and designed some of those products. Even today my real job's engineering department use their stuff regularly, their breakout boards are just so convenient for quick prototypes. Everything is manufactured proudly on home turf in their New York City office. I recommend all hobbyists to follow their blog, it's a good mix of electronics, 3D printing, art, and other fun news.

## Thanks to: PCBWay

PCBWay is a speedy and cheap PCB manufacturer and electronics assembly company. They generously provided us with multi-colour PCBs for free, so your robots can be more unique than just the usual green.

Their service is speedy and at a price that was unheard of before the maker movement took off, making it more accessible to hobbyists and students, allowing the little guys to keep up with the big tech companies. PCBWay also do a lot of community outreach to hobbyists and student teams, hosting contests and offering sponsorships.

Their PCBs are pretty high quality, there's nothing to complain about. Great looking silkscreen. Soldermask and drills are on point. Edges are milled clean. No splatter with the plating. No hassle using their website to order. Each one of our robot PCBs would cost roughly $3.50 each including shipping, and take one week from time-of-order to your doorstep. Great job PCBWay.
