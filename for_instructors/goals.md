# Goals

### Works at SSF Public Library

Everything is designed taking into account what the library can and cannot do. The class size limit accounts for the room size and staff availability. The complexity of a class is designed around 1 hour sessions. The software used is either web browser based or already installed on the library computers. 

### Extended Learning

The robot can be expanded upon. Components can be added to the circuit board, and a breadboard can be stuck to the back of the robot. Extra lessons can be given to students who wants to do upgrades.

Participants will compete in line-following races and mini sumo wrestling. They are encouraged to come back with improvements and a leader board will be kept for the small community. 

### Economical

All the components of the robot are dirt cheap, available in bulk from AliExpress, Amazon, or eBay. Leftover components can be used later for a repeat of the program or for other programs. Many of the components are already in the SSF Public Library's inventory.

We want hobby robotics to appear cheap and accessible to everyone. Which also encourages continued learning.

The time per class is carefully minimized while maximizing concepts being taught. The rooms at the library are shared between many different programs, the only class that requires a room is the soldering session. The rest can take place in a quiet corner of the library.

### Instant Gratification

Success encourages more success. At every step, the student should feel like they have accomplished something. The live soldering class will attempt to get the robot moving as soon as possible.

This library does have two 3D printers that can be used to print what the students create.

### Ease of Instruction

Videos are prepared well ahead of the class, while live demonstration is still used. The videos are short loops that can be left on a projector. This will allow the instructor (me) to help a pupil while other pupils can still watch the videos, or even skip ahead while the instructor helps somebody who is slightly behind.

The videos are silent with text captions. Good for accessibility, and a library.

The circuit board is well labeled with graphics that minimizes chances of mistakes.

NO MATH ALLOWED IN MY COURSEWARE :-) we don't want to bore anybody

### Starting from Minimal Components

The robot kits on Amazon all feel like good deals, but they don't teach anything. Those are all designed to look like you are getting "value" with a lot of parts, and made hard to fail at so they get good 5 star reviews. In doing so, they hide a lot of concepts that enable creativity.

For example, most of those kits on Amazon feature a TCRT5000 sensor but they are pre-assembled into a comparator circuit that outputs 1 or 0. Whereas the class here will link the concept of a potentiometer voltage divider to the phototransistor replacing one of two resistors in a voltage divider, thus forming an amplifier that reacts to light.
